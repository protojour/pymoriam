Memoriam documentation
======================

Memoriam is a software platform that takes care of much of the scaffolding needed in modern backend systems. We've combined Free and Open Source Software components with a highly configurable modular low-code approach, so that you can get a complete backend service up and running in no time.

Memoriam automatically generates detailed and secure REST and GraphQL APIs, and serves as a structured hub for your data domains, through which data is documented, verified and served. It can serve as a gateway for your services, allowing them to leverage these features, or extend the base functionality of the system.
