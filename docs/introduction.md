# Introduction

## What it is

Memoriam is a backend software platform that takes care of much of the scaffolding needed in modern backend systems. We've combined Free and Open Source Software components with a highly configurable modular low-code approach, so that you can get a complete backend service up and running in no time.

## How it works

Memoriam uses a database schema format to automatically provision a graph database. On top of this you can configure several domain schemas, each of which forms the basis of powerful, customizable, autogenerated REST and GraphQL APIs for your users, frontend clients or services to interact with. Together, the database- and domain schemas make up detailed documentation on how your data models are structured, how they relate, and how they are allowed to be used.

Microservices can interact with Memoriam using its APIs or through HTTP-based RPC calls that allow you to trigger actions to change or enrich data, or set off other actions in response to events.

Authentication and access control allow you to secure your data in a detailed way. Built-in search engine features allow your data to be indexed and searched. Audit logging allows you to keep a detailed log of changes to your data. Finally, bundled object storage allows you to store file data.
