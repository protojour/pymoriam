# Initial ArangoSearch functionality in Memoriam collects searchable data
# in a field called _index, to avoid potentially huge AQL constructs
# with multiple fields in multiple collections.
# This is the default configuration used with each linked collection:
default_collection_props: &default
  fields:
    _index:
      analyzers:
        - text_en

# Searchable collections are linked here:
view_props:
  links: {}

# Fields collected into _index from each collection are configured here:
index_fields: {}

# Configurable analyzers, not currently used
analyzers: []
